## What is this?
If you have been brought here, that means you probably saw my bot scraping your website. Worry not! I - the creator of said bot - am not using it for any malicious activities. Most if not all the times I'm using it for preservation or research purposes! I am trying to keep the bandwidth usage and request number as low as I possibly can to prevent spam and possible overloading of servers.
## Recent confirmed activities
Here I will be posting my scraper's activities to recognize which ones are fake and which are not. I can assure everyone that ANY activity of my scraper will be put accordingly here.
- [x] - `13 August 2024` - YouTube Preservation Project. The bot scrapes useful metadata of various YouTube analytics pages (including those containing metadata) and using those info it tries to find existing mirror of video. Mostly it is used for my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@polishyoutubearchive) dedicated to preservation of various polish channels.
## How can I stop this/contact for questions?
If you have been affected by this or you want to contact me for partner related things, such as APIs - you can contact me using the **email I left in my bot's user-agent**.
> [!CAUTION]
> My useragent won't **EVER** be different from the one present above. If you have questions if the request is legitimate you can also contact me and I'll reply as quick as possibly can.
